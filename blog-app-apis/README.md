# Blog Application with Spring Boot

This blog application is built using **Spring Boot** and features a complete set of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) APIs. It enables users to manage blog posts while enforcing **role-based authentication** using **JWT (JSON Web Token)** for secure access. Users are authenticated based on their roles, ensuring only authorized individuals can perform specific actions, such as adding or modifying content.

For data persistence, the application leverages **MySQL** as the database, providing a reliable and scalable solution. Each operation has been thoroughly tested using **Postman**, ensuring the functionality and stability of the APIs.

## Key Features:
- **CRUD operations** for managing blog posts.
- **Role-based authentication** using JWT for secure access.
- **MySQL integration** for data storage.
- **API testing** and validation using Postman.

This structure ensures that the application is secure, scalable, and efficient, making it suitable for a production environment.

## Technologies Used:
- **Spring Boot**
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**
- **MySQL**
- **Postman** for API testing
